    "Trend--- A trend represents the overall direction and movement of the data over time. It can be identified visually by observing\n",
    " whether the data points consistently increase, decrease, or remain relatively stable over an extended period. Another approach \n",
    " is to use statistical techniques like regression analysis or moving averages to estimate and quantify the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    " Trends provide insights into the long-term behavior of the variable. An upward trend indicates growth or \n",
    "positive development, while a downward trend suggests a decline. A stable trend implies a consistent and steady state of \n",
    "the variable.\n",

    "Seasonality--- Seasonality refers to regular and predictable patterns that occur within a specific time frame, such as daily,\n",
    " weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles. \n",
    "Seasonal patterns help understand regular fluctuations associated with specific time periods. They are often influenced by \n",
    "factors like holidays, weather conditions, or cultural events. Recognizing seasonality allows businesses to plan and adapt \n",
    "their strategies accordingly. For example, retailers can anticipate higher sales during holiday seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclical--- Cyclical patterns represent fluctuations that occur over a period longer than a season, but with no fixed or \n",
    "predictable duration. These cycles are often influenced by economic conditions, business cycles, or other external factors. \n",
    "Identifying cyclical patterns requires analyzing longer-term trends and using techniques like spectral analysis.\n",

    "Irregular/Random--- Irregular or random patterns exhibit no clear trend, seasonality, or cyclicality. They represent unpredictable\n",

    "    Delete--- Remove time points with missing values if they are relatively small in number and do not significantly affect\n",
    "     the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " Removing Outliers--- Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the typical behavior of the time series. \n",
    " Outliers can distort analysis results. Various outlier detection methods can be used, such as\n",
    "   Z-Score or Standard Deviation--- Identify data points that fall outside a certain number of standard deviations from the mean.\n",
    "   Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)--- Detect outliers based on the median and median absolute deviation.\n",
    "   Boxplots--- Visualize the distribution of the data and identify values outside the whiskers as potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    " Resampling and Aggregation--- Time series data may have different sampling frequencies or irregular intervals. Resampling can\n",
    "  be performed to convert the data into a uniform frequency.\n",
    "    Upsampling--- Increasing the frequency of the data by interpolation or filling missing values.\n",
    "    Downsampling--- Decreasing the frequency of the data by aggregating or averaging values over larger intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detrending and Deseasonalizing--- Trends and seasonality can be present in time series data. Detrending and deseasonalizing\n",
    " techniques help remove these components to focus on the underlying patterns or residuals:\n",
    "   Moving Averages--- Compute a moving average to smoothen out the trend and seasonality effects.\n",
    "   Differencing--- Subtracting consecutive values to remove trend or seasonality.\n",
    "   Seasonal Decomposition--- Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components using methods like \n",
    "   seasonal decomposition of time series  or classical decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling and Normalization--- Scaling the time series can be helpful when data values have different scales. Common techniques\n",

    " Handling Non-Stationarity--- Non-stationarity occurs when the statistical properties of the time series change over time. \n",
    " Techniques to handle non-stationarity include:\n",
